# Security Policy for Termella

Thank you for your interest in keeping **Termella** safe and secure.

This document outlines how to report security vulnerabilities responsibly and what to expect from the maintainers.

## 📬 Contact

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in Termella, please **do not open a public issue**.

Instead, contact us by:

- **Email:** security@codewithzaqar.dev  
  _(Use a secure method, e.g., encrypted email if available)_
- **PGP key:** (optional — include if you publish one)

Provide as much detail as possible in your report (steps to reproduce, affected versions, proof-of-concept, logs) to help us triage the issue.

---

## 🔎 Supported Versions

Termella follows semantic versioning. Security fixes apply only to:

- the **latest patch release** within each supported minor version
- versions not yet declared End-of-Life (EOL)

Please include the affected version numbers in your report.

---

## 🔐 Reporting Guidelines

To help us address the issue efficiently:

1. Describe the **type of vulnerability** (e.g., unsafe terminal output, code execution risk).
2. Include **full repro steps** and a minimal reproduction if possible.
3. Provide context such as the **OS, Python version, and Termella version**.
4. Share **impact details** — how an attacker could exploit the issue.

After a vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll:

- Acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- Coordinate with you on disclosure timing before public release.
- Publish a **security advisory** with fixes and guidance.

---

## 🛠 Disclosure Policy

Termella uses a **responsible disclosure approach**:

- We will work with reporters to fix issues before public announcement.
- We strive to release patches promptly once a valid issue is confirmed.
- Public disclosure will wait until a fix is available or after 90 days of initial report.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Security Updates

Security releases will be tagged in the repository and announced via:

1. GitHub Releases
2. Repository README
3. Project communication channels (if any)

Please subscribe to releases to stay informed of critical fixes.

---

## 🚫 Public Bug Reports

Public issues **should not** contain details of unpatched security vulnerabilities. This helps prevent malicious actors from exploiting them before a fix is available.

---

## 📌 Additional Notes

Termella does not currently offer a bug bounty program, but we appreciate and credit responsible disclosures.
